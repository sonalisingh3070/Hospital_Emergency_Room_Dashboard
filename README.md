Hospital dashboard -excel
## Project Overview
This project uses Excel to create an interactive dashboard for monitoring data from a hospital emergency room. The dashboard enables users to explore key metrics such as patient counts, wait times, admissions, and department-performance through filters and visuals.
## Objective
- Clean and prepare the raw Emergency Room dataset.  
- Use Excel (Power Query / Pivot Tables / Charts / Slicers) to build a fully interactive dashboard.  
- Provide actionable insights for hospital operations (e.g., wait time reduction, admissions trends, department load).
## Data Cleaning Process  
Performed in Excel using Power Query (or standard Excel techniques):  
- Remove duplicates and nulls.  
- Standardise date, time and numeric formats.  
- Create calculated fields (for instance: Wait Time, AdmissionRate, AvgÂ­PatientsPerHour).  
- Set up relationships (if multiple tables) and ensure data integrity.
##  Dashboard Features  
- Interactive slicers/filters (for e.g., Date, Department, Admission Status).  
- KPIs displayed prominently: Total Patients, Average Wait Time, Admissions vs Discharges,Patient Satisfaction Report .  
- Visuals such as line charts for trends, bar charts for department comparison, pie/donut for patient status breakdowns.
## Insights

- Number of patients
- Average Wait Time
- Patient Satisfactory Report
- Admission status
- Gender-wise Analysis
